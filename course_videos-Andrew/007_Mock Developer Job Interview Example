What are you passionate about in the world of software dev
Why do you do what you do?
        - watching a project evolve from scratch and seeing it come to fruition
Scenario: On a team, what do you do if you recognize you are in over your head?
        - try to break up the problem into pieces (I will probably know how to build some parts)
        - solve those parts, then seek help
Tell me a project that has totally failed. It's dead.
    - What was the main thing you learned from that project?
        if we would have taken a smaller approach, connect to one small part of the system, we would have seen the problems sooner

    - Git and gitHub
    - almost required when working with a team
    - also used Bitbucket, Gira, etc.
Documentation
    - not a big fan of code comments
        - "Code never lies, but comments sometimes do"
    - better to name variable and classnames in highly specific way
Do you test your own code?
    - r-spec

    - front end
        - not as specific on one app for testing (so many and all so similar)

    - level of transparent developer
    - devs who are not honest about what they do and don't know can slow things down the process and waste the organizations time

        - someone who will mentor and be honest and constructive with juniors
