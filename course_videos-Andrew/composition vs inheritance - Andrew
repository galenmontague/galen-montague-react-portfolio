higher order component
    passes functions through to another component as a property (using PROPS)
    runs a funciton in the class or parent component
    you are passing attributes in a non-inheritence way (it's passing on through properties instead)

to compose something you are perfroming a short cut instead of true inheritence

rather than inherit an entire component, just pass the one piece that is needed

We won't be creating higher order components usally (many already exist in React)
